  <h2>Lasagna</h2>

  <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta. It is usually served in overlapping sheets interspersed with layers of ingredients to taste, most frequently meat in bolognese sauce and bechamel.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>10-12 pre-cooked lasagna plates</li>
    <li>600 g minced beef</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>2 carrots</li>
    <li>2 stalks of celery</li>
    <li>500 g canned chopped tomato (or whole peeled tomato)</li>
    <li>500 ml of water</li>
    <li>80 g of grated cheese (cheddar, Parmesan or other)</li>
    <li>Salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps to make a lasgna</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Place a little olive oil in a saucepan or cocotte on the heat and add the minced meat with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Keep moving and separating the meat with the heat quite high.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cut the onion, carrots and celery into very small pieces so that they blend well into the sauce.</li>
    <li>To do it very quickly we have used the Gefu manual chopper.</li>
    <li>When the meat is browned, add the onion, carrot and celery.</li>
    <li>When the meat is browned, add the onion, carrot and celery. Cook for 8-10 minutes over medium heat. Add the chopped tomato and water, stir well and let it reduce for 1 hour, or until you achieve the consistency you want for your filling. Booking.</li>
    <li>While the sauce rests we are going to prepare the bechamel. </li>
    <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan and add 4 tablespoons of flour. Stir very well to toast the flour a little. </li>
    <li>Remove the pan from the heat and add the hot milk little by little while stirring with a hand whisk.</li>
    <li>Add a pinch of black pepper, another pinch of nutmeg and a little salt.</li>
    <li>When everything is integrated, put it back on the heat and cook without stopping stirring for 5-7 minutes over low heat, or until the sauce has thickened a little. For lasagna, a bechamel that is not too thick is better.</li>
    <li> If you have lumps left, 
    you can fix it with a touch of a mixer.</li>
    <li>To assemble the lasagna you need a baking dish of about 30 x 20 cm. Put a few tablespoons of meat filling at the base of the dish so that the lasagna does not stick.</li>
    <li>On top, place the pasta plates, a well-spread layer of meat and a few tablespoons of béchamel.</li>
    <li>Repeat this process two more times.</li>
    <li>Finish the lasagna with a layer of pasta sheets and cover with the bechamel and grated cheese on top.</li>
  </ol>
