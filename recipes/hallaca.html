    <li>Wash the meat very well and remove excess fat.</li>
    <li>Parboil each piece separately, 
      without softening them completely.<li>
    <li>The meat must be firm to prevent it from falling apart when preparing the stew.</li>
    <li>Reserve the broth that results from cooking 
      the beef and chicken.</li>
    <li>Separately, in a large pot, sauté onion, garlic, chives and garlic, and sauté for 5 minutes or until wilted.</li>
    <li>Add the paprika, sweet chili and 2 cups of broth.</li>
    <li>Let cook for a few more minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the meats, and add the rest of the ingredients, leaving finally the tomatoes, wine and marinade to taste.</li>
    <li>Cook the stew for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, being careful to prevent it from falling apart.</li>
    <li>Cook the stew until it thickens and let it rest, covered with a cloth, overnight.</li>
  </ol>

    <li>Knead the corn flour with the oil and broth.</li>
    <li>Form balls of 5 or 7 cm with your hands. approximately.</li>
  </ol>

    <li>Grease a large sheet with the onoto-colored oil.</li>
    <li>In the center, place a ball of dough and flatten it firmly until the dough is very thin, about 1 to 2 millimeters thick, uniform and in the shape of a circle.
    Then, pour 2 ½ tablespoons of the cold stew into the center of the dough.</li>
    <li>On top, place the decorations evenly distributed: 2 paprika strips, 2 olives and 6 raisins; The amount depends on taste.</li>

    <li>Tighten carefully and tie with wick, crossing it 3 times in each direction. It should always end in the center so that the mooring is more secure.</li>
    <li>Finally, in a pot with boiling water and salt, place the hallacas.
