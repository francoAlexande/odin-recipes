  <h3>Steps to make a Empanada</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>The water first in a bowl with the salt and sugar, little by little I add the corn flour, knead and then add the wheat flour, knead and let it rest while I assemble the work area.</li>
      <li>On a flat surface (I used a cutting board) we spread a plastic sheet (I cut a bag), which must be emulsified with fingers dipped in oil (I placed it in one of the small pots).</li>
      <li>I make a small ball with the dough (fist size), I wet my fingers in water (the other small bowl) and I flatten it in a round (the thinner the better, but be careful not to break it with the weight of the filling).</li>
      <li>I put the filling in the center (so that there is no liquid, otherwise the dough will break... a trick is to have the stew in the refrigerator so that the liquid is firm) 
      I close the edges and flatten it to finally form a half-moon shape with a round container.</li>
      <li>I remove and recycle the excess edge, and slowly peel off the plastic to pour into the hot oil.</li>
      <li> Let it brown on both sides and enjoy!
      The classic flavors of the fillings are: cheese, ground beef, shredded beef, chicken, fish. Combined like cheese and meat, cheese and black beans. And anything you can think of can serve as a filling for these wonders... there are those who make them baked but I don't know the technique, there are those who make beet, banana, etc. dough... you can accompany it with garlic sauce, tartar or any mojito or spicy. Enjoy!</li>
